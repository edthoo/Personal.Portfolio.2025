      Software Engineer who's always up for learning new things – whether it's
      the latest JavaScript framework or diving into some backend magic – and
      putting them to good use. I'm all about building web apps and features
      that actually make a difference for users. I'm a solid problem-solver,
      love collaborating with a team to tackle challenges, and really enjoy
      creating user-friendly, intuitive experiences.
